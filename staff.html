                    Naglaa Mohammed - Head of Arabic Department (Primary) </h3>
                <p>I am delighted to be a member of the Senior Leadership Team of Diyafah international School. I have been in teaching and educational leadership for the last twenty-four years in the UAE, with experience of Arabic, American and British curricula. I derive a great sense of personal satisfaction when I see students become fluent in reading and writing Arabic.  This language is the fifth most commonly spoken language in the world. <br><br>

                    The Primary Arabic Team, which I have the privilege of leading, is resolutely focused on developing the Arabic language in our school through improving our students’ speaking, listening, reading and writing skills,  both for native and non-native Arabic speakers. <br><br>
                    
                    We do this by  using unique online resources and modern, student centered teaching strategies. We also participate in local and national competitions held at various times throughout the year in the UAE. I look forward to working with you, our parents,  your sons and daughters and the staff of  Diyafah International School to ensure language study at our school goes from strength to strength. <br><br>
